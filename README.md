# AirKit Logbook

The [AirKit Logbook](https://airkit-logbook.citizensense.net/) has been developed as a resource for learning more about air quality and air pollution. It is part of the [AirKit toolkit](https://citizensense.net/kits/airkit/) for citizen-led air quality monitoring. The Logbook is available through this Github page or as as a [webpage and PDF](https://airkit-logbook.citizensense.net/). There is a [short version](https://github.com/citizensense/AirKit_Logbook/blob/main/toolkit_short.md) of the Logbook available as a quick start guide for setting up a Dustbox 2.0 air quality monitor. 

Within the Logbook there are resources to help you [set up an air quality project](https://github.com/citizensense/AirKit_Logbook/blob/main/toolkit.md#2-air-quality-monitoring) to monitor and improve air quality. The Logbook also contains instructions for [building a Dustbox 2.0](https://github.com/citizensense/AirKit_Logbook/blob/main/toolkit.md#3-building-a-dustbox-20), an air quality sensor for monitoring particulate matter. There are resources for [setting up, calibrating and using a Dustbox in the field](https://github.com/citizensense/AirKit_Logbook/blob/main/toolkit.md#4-setting-up-your-dustbox-in-the-field), and for [analyzing your data](https://github.com/citizensense/AirKit_Logbook/blob/main/toolkit.md#5-data-analysis-and-data-stories) on our data analysis platform, [Airsift](https://airsift.citizensense.net/), which allows you to view Dustbox data, map and record observations, and write data stories with citizen data. 

The AirKit Logbook has three Appendices that include an [FAQ and troubleshooting](https://github.com/citizensense/AirKit_Logbook/blob/main/toolkit.md#appendix-1-troubleshooting-and-faq) section to answer common questions relating to different elements of AirKit, instructions for [building your own Stevenson screen](https://github.com/citizensense/AirKit_Logbook/blob/main/toolkit.md#appendix-2-building-a-stevenson-screen) as a weatherproof Dustbox 2.0 shelter, and additional [resources on air quality](https://github.com/citizensense/AirKit_Logbook/blob/main/toolkit.md#appendix-3-additional-resources). This Github Logbook also contains links to software and hardware related to the Dustbox 2.0. These resources include Gerber files for printing the [Dustbox 2.0 PCB](https://github.com/citizensense/AirKit_Logbook/tree/main/dustbox_2_0_PCB/GerberFiles), [source code](https://github.com/citizensense/AirKit_Logbook/blob/main/dustbox_2.0_source_code_v13.zip) and [enclosure STL files](https://github.com/citizensense/AirKit_Logbook/tree/main/dustbox_2_0_stl_files) for 3D printing. You can view the source code for our [Airsift platform](https://github.com/citizensense/airsift3) on a related repository.

AirKit is developed through the [Citizen Sense](https://citizensense.net) project, which is led by Prof Jennifer Gabrys as part of the [Planetary Praxis](https://planetarypraxis.org/) research group in the Department of Sociology at the University of Cambridge. This research has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) to support [Citizen Sense](https://citizensense.net) through an ERC Starting Grant [313347](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/313347), and to support AirKit through an ERC Proof of Concept Grant [779921](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/779921). An extensive team of researchers and collaborators contributed to AirKit, and they are listed in our [Acknowledgments](https://github.com/citizensense/AirKit_Logbook/blob/main/toolkit.md#6-summary-and-acknowledgments).
