# AirKit Logbook

The AirKit Logbook has been developed as a resource for learning more about air quality and air pollution. It is part of the AirKit toolkit for citizen-led air quality monitoring. Within the logbook there are resources to help you [set up an air quality project](https://github.com/citizensense/AirKit_Logbook/blob/master/toolkit.md#2-air-quality-monitoring) or campaign to improve air quality. The Logbook also contains instructions for [building, setting up, calibrating and using](https://github.com/citizensense/AirKit_Logbook/blob/master/toolkit.md#3-building-a-dustbox-20) an air quality sensor for monitoring particulate matter, the Dustbox 2.0. There are resources for analyzing your data on our data analysis platform, [Airsift](https://airsift.citizensense.net/), which allows you to map and record observations and to generate data stories with citizen data. The AirKit Logbook has three Appendices that include an FAQ and troubleshooting section to answer common questions relating to different elements of AirKit, instructions for building your own Stevenson screen as a weatherproof Dustbox 2.0 shelter, and additional resources on air quality.
